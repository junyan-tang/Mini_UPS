Since we wonâ€™t have access to real warehouses and trucks, our code will interact with a simulated world provided. We connect to the simulation server (port 12345 for UPS, port 23456 for Amazon), and send commands and receive notifications.

For Amazon, we have a web interface on which someone can buy a product. We then go through all the steps to get the package delivered.
 
For UPS, we have a web interface which will display the shipments that exist, and their status (e.g. created, truck en route to warehouse, truck waiting for package, out for delivery).
