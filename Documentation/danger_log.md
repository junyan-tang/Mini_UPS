# Danger Log

This document outlines potential risks and vulnerabilities our web application might face under specific conditions.

## 1. High Concurrency

**Problem**: Currently, our server handles communication with external services using a single-threaded approach, and our database operations lack atomic guarantees. This could lead to race conditions and data inconsistencies under high load.

**Possible Solution**: Implement multi-threading or asynchronous processing to handle concurrent requests efficiently. Additionally, integrate transaction mechanisms to ensure atomicity of database operations.

## 2. Slow Docker Start Up

**Problem**: Using 'gradle bootrun' for service restarts results in extended downtime, which can be costly in terms of both user experience and financial impact.

**Possible Solution**: Optimize Docker container orchestration by using pre-built images and minimizing service dependencies. Explore faster deployment strategies such as blue-green deployments to reduce downtime.

## 3. Security Risk

**Problem**: The server side has unrestricted access to modify database contents, which could be exploited by malicious attacks, particularly if the server is compromised.

**Possible Solution**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to limit database access. Employ regular security audits and intrusion detection systems to identify and mitigate risks.

## 4. High Availability

**Problem**: The system lacks an error handling mechanism to cope with unexpected shutdowns. Current restart procedures involve data deletion and reinitialization, risking data loss.

**Possible Solution**: Develop a more resilient error recovery process including data replication and failover strategies to maintain service continuity. Implement regular backups and test recovery procedures to ensure data integrity.

## 5. Imbalanced Workload

**Problem**: The system does not have a workload balancing mechanism, making it vulnerable to service disruptions under sudden surges in traffic.

**Possible Solution**: Integrate a load balancer, such as Nginx, to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple server instances. Consider scaling solutions, both horizontal and vertical, to adjust resources dynamically based on real-time demand.
